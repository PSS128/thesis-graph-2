# Advanced Prompt Templates - Summary

## Overview

I've created **research-grade, sophisticated prompt templates** that go far beyond the basic templates. These are designed for academic-quality causal graph construction with theoretical grounding and methodological rigor.

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. `backend/app/prompts/node_extraction.py` (507 lines)
**Advanced node extraction with:**
- Domain-specific guidance (economics, psychology, medicine, policy)
- Context awareness (existing nodes, thesis statement)
- Quality criteria for variable naming (specificity, measurability, level of analysis)
- Extended output schema: `theoretical_role`, `level_of_analysis`, `temporal_scope`, `similar_to_existing`
- Few-shot examples with complete schemas
- 3-5x more detailed than basic template

### 2. `backend/app/prompts/edge_rationale.py` (721 lines)
**Advanced edge rationale with causal inference framework:**
- Support for 4 edge types: CAUSES, MODERATES, MEDIATES, CONTRADICTS
- Theory-driven mechanism identification (biological, psychological, social, economic)
- Explicit assumption enumeration (SUTVA, temporal precedence, no reverse causality)
- Systematic confounder detection with severity ratings (CRITICAL/MODERATE/MINOR)
- Evidence hierarchy (RCTs, quasi-experiments, IV, longitudinal studies)
- Effect heterogeneity across subgroups
- Testable predictions and falsification tests
- Domain-specific frameworks

### 3. `backend/app/prompts/README.md`
Complete documentation with usage examples, integration guide, and customization instructions

### 4. `backend/ADVANCED_PROMPTS_DEMO.py`

## üéØ Key Features

### Node Extraction Template

**Basic (Original):**
```
System: 182 chars
Output: {name, definition, synonyms, measurement_ideas}
```

**Advanced:**
```
System: 2,984 chars (+1,540% increase)
Output: {name, definition, synonyms, measurement_ideas,
         theoretical_role, level_of_analysis,
         temporal_scope, similar_to_existing}
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Quality criteria: Specificity, measurability, domain-appropriate terminology
- ‚úÖ Definition requirements: 15-30 words, construct boundaries, theoretical framework
- ‚úÖ Synonym guidelines: Formal/colloquial variants, abbreviations, related concepts (marked with ~)
- ‚úÖ Measurement ideas: 4-8 methods mixing quantitative/qualitative, validated instruments, data sources
- ‚úÖ Domain-specific guidance: Specialized prompts for economics, psychology, medicine, policy
- ‚úÖ Context integration: Checks against existing nodes, aligns with thesis
- ‚úÖ Few-shot examples: 2 complete examples with full schemas

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "Work-Related Burnout",
  "definition": "Psychological exhaustion resulting from prolonged exposure to chronic workplace stressors...",
  "synonyms": ["occupational burnout", "job burnout", "emotional exhaustion", "~compassion fatigue"],
  "measurement_ideas": [
    "Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - 22-item validated scale (interval)",
    "Self-reported sick leave days due to stress (count data)",
    "Cortisol levels via hair samples (biomarker, ratio)"
  ],
  "theoretical_role": "mediator",
  "level_of_analysis": "individual",
  "temporal_scope": "chronic",
  "similar_to_existing": "Workplace Stress"
}
```

### Edge Rationale Template

**Basic (Original):**
```
System: 189 chars
Output: {mechanisms, assumptions, likely_confounders, prior_evidence_types}
```

**Advanced:**
```

Output: {mechanisms, assumptions, likely_confounders,
         prior_evidence_types, effect_heterogeneity,
         testable_predictions}
```

**Improvements:**

  - Temporal precedence
  - No reverse causality
  - SUTVA (no interference)
  - Monotonicity
  - Excludability
  - Measurement validity
  - Functional form

**3. Confounders:**
- Systematic detection strategy
- Categorized (demographic, contextual, behavioral, biological, structural)
- Severity ratings: [CRITICAL], [MODERATE], [MINOR]
- Explains why each confounds both A and B

**4. Evidence Types:**
- Hierarchy of causal evidence (RCT ‚Üí quasi ‚Üí IV ‚Üí longitudinal ‚Üí observational)
- Specific identification strategies
- Feasibility and ethical considerations

**5. Effect Heterogeneity (NEW):**
- Subgroup analysis suggestions
- Moderator identification
- Directional predictions

**6. Testable Predictions (NEW):**
- Dose-response expectations
- Mediator checks
- Temporal patterns
- Falsification tests

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "mechanisms": [
    "Increased cerebral blood flow via cardiovascular improvements delivers oxygen to prefrontal cortex",
    "Upregulation of BDNF enhances neuroplasticity in hippocampus",
    "Reduced systemic inflammation decreases cytokine-mediated impairment"
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "Temporal precedence: Exercise occurs before cognitive assessment",
    "No reverse causality: Cognitive function does not determine exercise",
    "SUTVA: No spillover effects between participants"
  ],
  "likely_confounders": [
    "[CRITICAL] Baseline cognitive ability: Affects both exercise adherence and outcomes",
    "[CRITICAL] Socioeconomic status: Access to facilities and baseline resources",
    "[MODERATE] Genetic factors: APOE-Œµ4 affects motivation and Alzheimer's risk"
  ],
  "prior_evidence_types": [
    "RCT: Randomize sedentary adults to exercise vs control for 6 months",
    "Mendelian randomization: Genetic variants as instrumental variable"
  ],
  "effect_heterogeneity": [
    "Stronger for older adults (60+) due to age-related cognitive decline",
    "May be null for severe cognitive impairment (floor effects)"
  ],
  "testable_predictions": [
    "Dose-response: More exercise frequency ‚Üí larger cognitive gains",
    "Temporal: Gains emerge after 3-6 months for neuroplastic changes"
  ]
}
```

system, user = get_extraction_prompts(
    text,
    use_advanced=False,
    include_examples=False
)

# Slow but highest quality
system, user = get_extraction_prompts(
    text,
    domain="psychology",
    existing_nodes=nodes,
    thesis=thesis,
    use_advanced=True,
